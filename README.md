# TicTacToe

##Information
This is my own version of Tic-Tac-Toe / Noughts and Crosses. Currently, there are two versions in the repository:
* 2-Player-Text.py is the two-player, console-based version of the game, This was the first version of the game and so there are likely many improvements that can be made to it
* 1-Player-Pygame.py is the one-player, graphical version. It uses the pygame library for pygame to function. The AI in this game is completely random and follows no methodology.

If you wish to make any improvements at all, please feel free to fork, commit and then make a pull request.

##Changelog
* 26/05/2016 19:44 GMT - Added the 1 player python file, 1-Player-Pygame.py in the repo.
* 14/02/2015 11:59 GMT - Finished the 2 Player python file, 2-Player-Text.py in the repo.
* 14/02/2015 09:25 GMT - Added the unfinished python file, which at the moment allows you to make an infinite number of moves   until you get a line.
