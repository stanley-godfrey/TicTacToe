# TicTacToe

##Information
This is a, though basic, Tic Tac Toe clone that I have made in Python at home over the February Half-Term.
It is still not complete however, so if you do wish to make any changes of your own, then please feel free to.

##Changelog
* 14/02/2015 09:25 GMT - Added the unfinished python file, which at the moment allows you to make an infinite number of moves   until you get a line.
